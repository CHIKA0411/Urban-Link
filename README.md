## AI Hackathon Project: Maintenance Bill Optimization

Welcome to our AI Hackathon project repository! This project is focused on optimizing maintenance billing for apartments and cities using advanced AI and machine learning techniques. Our goal is to streamline maintenance processes, reduce costs, and improve overall resource management.

### *Key Features:*
- *Predictive Maintenance:* Utilizes XGBoost Regression to predict maintenance needs and schedules, minimizing unexpected breakdowns and enhancing efficiency.
- *Cost Optimization:* Implements the Adam optimizer to minimize costs associated with maintenance activities and resource allocation.
- *Automated Billing:* Automates the billing process using Power BI, ensuring accurate and timely billing for maintenance services.
- *Resource Management:* Employs classification algorithms and database management to efficiently allocate resources and manage maintenance tasks.
- *Resident Feedback Integration:* Integrates resident feedback through web development, backtracking to the database, and utilizing Generative AI for insights and improvements.
- *Community Connector:* Features a calendar-based community connector to facilitate communication and scheduling among residents and maintenance teams.
